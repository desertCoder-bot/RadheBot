## Project Overview

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I've whipped up this cool chatbot that lets you pick your favorite LLM (Language Learning Model) to chat with. It's like having a bunch of AI buddies at your fingertips! This project was my way of showing off what I learned in my MCA program.

## Objectives

- Create a chatbot that's easy to use and fun to interact with
- Give users the power to choose which LLM they want to chat with
- Make the whole thing look good and work smoothly

## Technologies Used

- Backend: Python (because it's awesome!)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (the holy trinity of web dev)
- LLMs: [List the LLMs you've integrated]

## Features

- Pick your LLM buddy from a list
- Chat away with your chosen AI friend
- Slick and user-friendly interface (if I do say so myself)
